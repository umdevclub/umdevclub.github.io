              For ease of use, we'll be using the Github CLI (Command Line
              Interface) for authenticating and connecting Git with Github.
              Download the Github CLI from here:{" "}
              <a
                href="https://cli.github.com/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
              >
                cli.github.com
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>After it's downloaded, follow the prompts to install it.</p>

        text: () => (

            <p>
              After installation, open your terminal and type the following:
            </p>
            <Code text="gh auth login" />
            <p>
              And use your arrow keys and hit the Enter key to the options shown
              below: (GitHub.com, HTTPS, Yes, and Login with a web browser).
            </p>

        text: () => (

            <p>
              After you've logged in, you should see a message that says
              "Authentication complete. Press Enter to continue."{" "}
